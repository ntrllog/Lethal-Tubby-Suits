/*  LETHAL COMPANY MOD - ADDITIONAL SUITS

    this file contains all custom suit definitions used for the additional suits mod
    to add a new suit, simply add a new entry to this listing & add your texture image to the resources folder

    entry breakdown:
      - suitID: unique identifier used in-game to identify the item (doesn't do anything atm, but will be needed for shop unlocks)
      - suitName: name that will be displayed when the player hovers over the suit in game
      - suitTexture: name of the texture image that will be used to render the suit (include file extension)
